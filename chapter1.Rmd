# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*  

The course seems really interesting. It's cool that we have an enthusiastic teacher. I wonder if many researchers in medicine use R markdown?  

Took my first steps with R markdown and Github today. Haven't managed to change the theme of GitHub pages, this is top priority so I'm working on it.
